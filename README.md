# 3D_Synapse_Reconstruction
This is the implementation code of 'A 3D Instance Segmentation Network for Synapse Reconstruction from Serial Electron Microscopy Images'.

# Environment
The code is developed and tested under the following configurations.

•	Hardware: more than 1 Nvidia GPUs with at least 24G GPU memory

•	Software: Ubuntu 18.04, Keras=2.2.4, python=3.5

# How to Use
Adjust the input data path (include train data and test data, and point the save path for solving result) and run the main function. The result will be saved in specified path. If you want to example other datasets, please adjust the input data as the same as the above Test Data.
